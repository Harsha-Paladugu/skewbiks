# Skewbiks.com port plan and status

The approved milestone plan for porting the pyraminx-oo codebase to the Skewb, with live
status. Companion doc: `skewb-ground-truth.md` (machine-verified domain facts + sources).
User-facing decisions already made: fork (not monorepo); v1 = Home + OO census + Algorithms
+ Trainer + Method solver; trainer = three tools (case/alg drill, full-solve timer +
analysis, case recognition) as modes of one bundle; solver method lineup decided at M7;
new Firebase project; domain skewbiks.com (GitHub Pages, CNAME).

## Status

- [x] **M0 — Bootstrap** (`84416fd`): identity fork (titles/OG/wordmark/CNAME/robots/
  sitemap/package.json), demo-mode config, LF-normalized tree, `upstream` remote.
- [x] **M1 — Engine** (`b303ad9`): Skewb `js/engine.js` behind the identical
  `window.OOEngine` surface. State `{ctr[6], fx[4], fp[4], fo[4]}`; native moves = axis
  tetrad {UBR, UFL, DFR, DBL}; written WCA `B` (free corner DBR) + `x/y/z` resolve through
  applyParsed's frame machinery; `nativeToWCA` converts solver output; case keying folds
  the y² view only (90° y swaps tetrads — NOT a state symmetry; the 4 presentations pair at
  data level via the sheet `direction` field). Dense index NSLOTS = 360×12×2187 = 9,447,840.
  Dropped from the contract: `applyMoveK`, `rotateFrame`, `openOfEkey`, `barOfEkey`, `XO`.
  Added: facelet model (`toFacelets`/`fromFacelets`/`WCA_FACELET_MOVES`), `enumFreeSlots`
  spec-object signature, `CLASS` (free-perm A4/V4 classes). `tools/test-engine.mjs` 32/32
  (44 after the M3 notation/display additions);
  `npm run test:space` matches OEIS A079745 + class oracles.
- [x] **M2/M3 — Census slice** (`4f3d057`): `js/render.js` rebuilt on the facelet model
  (net = front/back orthographic corner views; 3D cube; same 5-member contract);
  `js/tables.js` parameterized (IndexedDB `skewbiks-oo`); `js/oo.js`/`oo.html` Skewb copy.
  Verified: in-browser first build ~18 s; census shows 262,674 positions (= oracle);
  mirror pairs, 12 unique views, verified scrambles, instant cached reload.
  - **2026-07-03 update (user request):** census classes now fold the FULL 24-element
    group (`E.makeFullCanon`, cache key `oo-classes-v2`) → **131,391 positions**; a
    position + its mirror are one class/ordinal/done-bit (pairId == classId of the rep;
    old `#/c/<id>` links still resolve). Notation: WCA everywhere by default + a
    **WCA / NS switch** in the nav (`localStorage skewbiks-notation`; engine gained
    `parseAlg(str,'ns')`, `wcaToNS`/`nsToWCA`/`convertAlg`, NS-aware `mirrorAlg` —
    mapping in skewb-ground-truth.md §NS). Solutions store the notation they were typed
    in (`notation: 'wca'|'ns'` doc field; rules + fixtures updated). Net/3D re-anchored
    to the WCA scrambling hold (front = U/F/L, UFL toward viewer; back = D/B/R) so
    scrambles match the in-hand view and mirror pairs render as visual reflections.
  - **2026-07-03 fix 2 (user report: "B looked like an F move"):** two frame bugs —
    `applyParsed`/`nativeToWCA` advanced the B-frame in the WRONG DIRECTION (every move
    after a written B acted on the wrong corner; self-consistent in-engine, wrong vs a
    real cube), and diagrams rendered raw pinned facelets (UFL corner appeared to twist).
    Fixed: frame steps `amt % 3`, and all rendering now goes through `E.toFixedFacelets`
    (WCA-hold presentation; white/red/green corner always reads solved). Display now
    matches the TNoodle fixed-frame vectors + KPW 2015 scramble exactly (4 new tests;
    see ground-truth §"Two frame rules"). Census dist/class tables unaffected (native
    moves only). Old demo-mode solutions verified under the inverted frame may fail
    re-verification — expected.
  - **2026-07-03 Phase-0 cleanup (post-review, commit after `12c5483`):** full OO
    code review found no structural problems; landed fixes: home "random unsolved"
    no longer lands on the solved position (skips depth-0); `pairOf` + the approval
    transaction re-derive the class rep by FULL 24-sym canonicalization (a forged
    non-canonical `classId` could previously verify+approve but never set the
    done-bit); class-table build switched to an ascending orbit sweep — first
    unvisited reachable index is the rep — 1.0s vs 22.6s in Node, reps/depths
    verified byte-identical, cache key unchanged; bitmap bit-twiddling extracted to
    `testBit`/`setBit`; dead exports pruned (engine `mirrorToken`/`parsedToNative`/
    `NS_CORNER`, render `STICKERS`); `render.js` now uses the same shadowed-module
    IIFE as engine.js/tables.js (the old `typeof module` branch silently skipped
    `window.OORender` under the documented Node window-stub recipe).
- [x] **M4 — Firebase** (2026-07-03 agent side; USER console steps completed 2026-07-06).
  Project **`skewbiks`** + web app created via MCP; creds in `js/config.js` (demo mode
  off); `.firebaserc` pins the project; rules deployed (verified byte-identical via
  `firebase_get_security_rules`). Rules tests: 25/25 green against the emulator
  (`npm i --no-save @firebase/rules-unit-testing firebase`, then
  `npx -y firebase-tools@13 emulators:exec --only firestore "node test/firestore.rules.test.mjs"`
  — firebase-tools 14+ needs Java 21, machine has 17; recipe in the test header), incl.
  2 new delete tests. Review carry-items landed: (a) solutions delete stays admin-only
  (it's the cap-race recovery path) + new admin **Recompute solved bitmap** action
  (`liveDB.recompute()`: rebuilds meta/doneMap + meta/stats from approved docs' classId
  — state indexes, enumeration-independent — so it doubles as the KEY_CLASSES migration
  tool); (b) persistence formats FROZEN in skewb-ground-truth.md §"OO census persistence
  formats"; (c) pageMod scramble/solution now display through the WCA/NS switch
  (verification still runs on stored text + notation).
  **Firestore DB creation is console-only on Spark** (API/CLI CreateDatabase requires
  billing — confirmed against Firebase docs), so it was a USER step; deferred
  2026-07-05, **COMPLETED 2026-07-06 by the USER**. Verified via Firebase MCP: the
  `(default)` Firestore DB exists (nam5, native mode, created 2026-07-04), the
  deployed rules match `firestore.rules`, and the `admins` / `meta` / `solutions`
  collections are live — i.e. sign-in, the admin bootstrap and a live submit
  round-trip all happened. **The census backend is ON**; demo mode stays off.
  SETUP.md remains the reference walkthrough for a rebuild-from-scratch.
- [x] **M5 — Sheet pipeline + Algorithms page + alg data v0** (2026-07-06). Pipeline
  re-keyed through engine helpers only: renderKey = full-state `stateKey`, canon =
  `realCanonKey` y²-fold; PRES entries are `[renderKey, name]`; DEFERRED namespace +
  every L4E-merge/TL4E-split special case deleted; `data/prior-sheet.json` = `{}` and
  `broken-algs.json` = `[]` (both mechanisms kept, empty); the compiler now also
  GENERATES `data/classmap.json` (canon → lowercased subset id, first subset wins,
  conflicts reported). Engine: `preprocessAlg` strips `[setup]` brackets (y-family
  setups are real rotation tokens on a Skewb); 2 new tests → 46/46. **Direction
  convention pinned operationally** (there is NO state-level 90° y symmetry — pure
  facelet/conjugation relations between presentations don't exist, verified): 
  `prependAUF(p, frontAlg)` = alg for p = 0 Front / 1 Right / 2 Back / 3 Left ("case
  on the Right → y → run the Front alg"); machine-verified: `caseStateOf` of a
  y²-prefixed alg == the y²-sym image (so Front/Back share one canon, Right/Left the
  other — a case is ≤ 2 canons; engine test added). algs.js kept the editor chassis,
  replaced the taxonomy: data-driven SECTIONS (one tab per JSON subset, authored
  order, lands on first non-empty), case cards group algs by the EXACT presentation
  state each solves (no per-row realignment needed) with direction labels computed
  from the case anchor, sidebar = case anchors, WCA/NS toolbar switch (shared
  `skewbiks-notation` pref; NS input converted and stored as WCA), draft key
  `skewbiks-algsheet-draft`, export = `skewb_algs.json` (deep-clone + deltas, no
  remapping). **Alg data v0 is a MACHINE-GENERATED seed** (BFS-optimal algs;
  generator in the session scratchpad): subsets FL / Sarah-Intermediate /
  Sarah-Advanced / NS (the proposal — still awaiting user confirmation), with
  Sarah-Intermediate seeded: 18 cases / 135 algs = both LL-corner-twist cases
  (centers solved; 8 states → 2 y-orbits) + all 16 last-layer center-perm cases
  (corners AND the D center solved — the post-FL center space, even perms of the
  5 remaining centers; 59 states → 16 y-orbits, exhaustive over that pool).
  Case names are descriptive
  placeholders ("Two corners twisted", "Centers 3-cycle F→L→B") — USER authoring
  replaces/extends via the page editor or the JSON. Gates: `npm run build` fully
  green (check-sheet: 135 algs, 0 NOSOLVE, structure clean), `check:fresh` green,
  `%\s*3` absent from all M5 surfaces, algs.html verified in headless Edge (NOTE:
  virtual-time starves on this page — no CPU pin; use playwright-core with
  channel msedge for real waits), engine tests 46/46.
  - **Same-day post-review fixes (multi-agent review, 11 confirmed findings):**
    compiler — identity algs (empty string, "R R'") now FAIL the build instead of
    minting a bogus solved-state case, and no output is written on ANY failed
    check (the unparseable-skip and coverage-gap failures previously fired after
    the write); check-sheet — PRES↔ALG/CNAME structural checks are now
    bidirectional plus a solved-key guard; engine — preprocessAlg strips brackets
    only around pure-ROTATION groups (commutator notation "[R, U]" is rejected,
    not silently misread as "R U"), and nsToWCA now routes through preprocessAlg
    (the NS-mode adder accepts bracketed setups it displays); algs.js — exportJSON
    publishes the admin's saved row order and recomputes meta.counts, and the
    localStorage draft self-heals against the published baseline on load (no
    duplicate rows after export → commit → redeploy); check-fresh now also covers
    data/classmap.json; README data-flow + the seed's center section labels
    corrected ("Last layer centers"). Engine tests 48/48.
  - **Alg data v1 — real method sheets imported (2026-07-06).** USER supplied the
    advanced-method sheets as JSON (TCLL "Full TCLL - Max Parris", EG2.xlsx, NS
    2026_ns_sheet.xlsx); committed verbatim under `data/sources/` and imported by the
    new re-runnable `tools/import-method-sheets.mjs` (NS→WCA conversion, state-verified;
    duplicate-name merge; per-alg provenance `ns`/`rating`/`firstMove`). The
    machine-generated Sarah-Intermediate v0 seed cases were REMOVED (subset shells kept;
    Sarah's sheets to come — extend the importer's ADAPTERS). Result: subsets NS 135 /
    EG2 136 / TCLL 1078 cases = **1,349 cases / 3,114 algs**, compile + check-sheet +
    check:fresh green, engine tests 48/48, algs.html verified in headless Edge
    (playwright-core, channel msedge — plain --screenshot still virtual-time-starves).
    **Notation finding (machine-derived, dual-oracle verified — see importer header +
    data/sources/README.md): the sheets' rotation letters are NOT WCA — sheet x/y/z =
    engine z'/y'/x** (move letters are standard fc2 NS). Only mid-alg rotations
    distinguish the conventions (leading rotations conjugate the case), which is why
    959 mid-rot algs scattered under the identity reading. Sheet cases are
    orientation-free (alternates solve from arbitrary holds → one authored case may
    span several canons; each alg keys to the exact state it solves). ~1% of algs
    flagged `"suspect": true` (off their case's plurality rotation class = sheet
    typos; suspects sort last so they never anchor a case card); 2 identity algs
    dropped (NS 137a, sheet-rated "poor"). Same-day follow-up (USER request): the
    Algorithms page gained a data-driven second-level nav — the importer emits each
    case's structured sheet fields (corner/sign/id/center/caseId/centerPattern) plus a
    per-subset `nav` block ({group, filter, sort}); algs.js renders group pills
    (NS/EG2: Pi/Peanut/…; TCLL: TCLL+/TCLL−) + a per-group dropdown (center pattern /
    center case / corner set) and sorts cases by ID (natural sort for NS caseIds,
    U-FL-FR-BR-BL order for EG2/TCLL). Search deliberately spans the whole subset,
    ignoring group/filter. Subsets without `nav` (FL, Sarah-*) keep the flat view.
    Second follow-up (USER): case cards now show a **first-move table** — all 8
    possible first moves (r r' R R' B B' b b', the sheets' convention) with each
    group's algs filed under the first move they make FROM THE ANGLE THE DIAGRAM
    SHOWS (so a solver can pick the alg that cancels their last first-layer move),
    and the alg text is the **authored sheet notation verbatim, rotations included**
    (the `ns` field, shown in BOTH toggle modes — WCA's 4 letters can't express the
    free-corner moves, so no rotation-preserving WCA form exists; the rotationless
    conversion stays for keying + the WCA input mode; algs.html defaults to NS). The
    first-move keys render as a fixed-width highlighted chip column (accent; empty =
    dim dashed chip), rotation tokens inside alg text are tinted blue — two distinct
    highlights by design. Per-alg `firstMove` is computed at import — the WCA
    conversion's first token IS the physical first move in the diagram frame; the
    sheets' letter convention for it is the fixed map {WCA R→B, U→b, L→r, B→R}
    (validated 1320 agree / 42 differ vs the sheets' own columns; disagreements are
    kept per-alg as `firstMoveSheet`, mostly the suspect algs). Rating chips
    (best/poor) shown; best sorts first within a first-move row.
- [x] **M6 — Trainer** (2026-07-06). `src/trainer/skewb-trainer.jsx` + `skewb-core.mjs`
  (the substrate is plain ESM so `tools/test-trainer.mjs` can import it in Node); the
  Pyraminx `l5e-trainer.jsx` was DELETED (git history retains it). Chassis kept: rAF
  timer + space/tap (350 ms tap-guard ref now inits to `-Infinity` — a warm-IndexedDB
  boot beats 350 ms and swallowed the first Space), `window.storage` under NEW key
  `skewb-trainer-v1` (shape-validated hydration, NO migrations), session pills,
  per-case stats, recap queue. **Data source: the trainer fetches
  `data/skewb_algs.json` at runtime** (algs.js pattern) — the compiled SHEET lacks the
  ns/rating/firstMove/nav fields it shows; bundle 416→172 KB. Dist table =
  `OOTables.loadOrBuildDist` shared with the census (trainer.html now loads
  `js/tables.js`); masked scrambles ported onto `E.idx`/`applyMoveIdx` (native pairs
  `m>>1`/`m^1`, length window [9,12] vs diameter 11, fallback `optimalScramble`).
  Three modes:
  ① **Drill/Recap** — group-based picker from the subsets' `nav` blocks (group pills +
  per-case browser with the nav filter dropdown), per-subset **view toggles
  Front/Right/Back/Left** (default Front; targets synthesized
  `caseStateOf(prependAUF(p, frontAlg))` — ALL 3,114 v1 algs are Front-authored);
  reveal shows a y-rotation chip + the authored NS text verbatim + first-move chips +
  rating tags (suspects trail); stats keyed (subset, case, direction); scope
  All/Learning/Known + known marks per view (pool edits swap the pending problem
  WITHOUT clearing a stop-screen reveal — marking known must not eat it).
  ② **Full solve** — uniform random reachable state (rejection sample on dist),
  masked scramble; analysis = direct-optimal lines (capped DFS descent) + a
  first-layer decomposition (best FL line by total over capped optimal-FL descents +
  optimal finish) via a second multi-source goal-distance BFS — seeds = 6 faces ×
  540 `enumFreeSlots` layer states, **max FL distance is 6** — built lazily on first
  open, cached under the trainer-owned IndexedDB key `trainer-fldist-v1`.
  ③ **Recognition** — reveal-style self-graded (USER decision, supersedes the old
  "multiple choice" sketch) at a coin-flipped y² view (the y²-sym image IS the d+2
  presentation — engine-tested). Same-day follow-up (USER request): after the reveal
  you grade yourself — Recognized ✓ (key 1) / Missed ✗ (key 2), space still skips
  ungraded; grades persist per case (`recogStats` in the same storage blob), the
  stats card shows graded/recognized/accuracy/mean-reveal plus a worst-cases grid,
  and session pills carry ✓/✗. Second follow-up (USER request, same-day rev 2 —
  the interim "3 random centers + 2 random corners" form was replaced before
  release): a **center-case quiz view** ("Center cases"). Each round shows the
  WHOLE first layer ("assume a layer is solved") plus a **user-chosen 3-center
  combo** (any 3 of L/F/R/B/U, FIFO-swap picker, persisted `centerSel`) and —
  behind a "+2 corners" toggle — 2 random whole U-layer corners; everything
  else is masked (netSVG gained `opts.mask` of display facelet indices; the
  piece→display mapping goes through the fixed-frame rotation, rebuilt in
  skewb-core from the exported `moveFaceletPerm`/`WCA_FACELET_MOVES` and pinned
  against `toFixedFacelets` by test). The answer is **multiple choice over the
  data's center-case fields** (NS `centerPattern`: Swirl/Wat/X/Horizontal U/
  Vertical U/O/Z Perm Conjugates/Triple Sledge/H-or-Z…; EG2/TCLL `center`
  values when those subsets are pooled; options are pool-derived, keys 1–9/0)
  plus **Don't know**; grading is automatic, per-center-case accuracy +
  don't-know counts persist (`centersStats`), and each reveal lists any other
  center cases the shown view was also consistent with. Machine check
  (test-asserted): with FL + any 3 centers, the worst combo still determines
  the NS center case for 93.3% of views. Substrate tests 29. WCA/NS toolbar switch (shared `skewbiks-notation`,
  default ns). `R.COLORS` un-exported (M6 carry-item resolved). New
  `npm run test:trainer` = 23 substrate tests (model counts vs the JSON, presentation
  geometry incl. the p/p+2 canon fold, masked-scramble correctness + window, layer
  predicate/seeds/goal-dist, analysis round-trips). Gates: `npm run build` +
  `check:fresh` green, engine tests 48/48 untouched, headless-Edge E2E
  (playwright-core, channel msedge, real waits) drives all three modes end-to-end —
  including a scramble-reproduces-the-shown-diagram check and reload persistence.
  - **2026-07-06 follow-up (USER request): mode ④ One-look** — self-graded case
    prediction during inspection (Got it ✓ key 1 / Missed ✗ key 2, space = reveal/
    next, reveal shows time-to-reveal; per-setting accuracy in `onelookStats`,
    session pills carry ✓/✗). Two sub-views: **Random** — a uniform state whose
    nearest layer (any face) is EXACTLY the chosen N ∈ 0..6 moves away (rejection
    sampling on the `trainer-fldist-v1` fiber; machine-checked histogram over the
    3,149,280 reachable states: 3,110 / 24,880 / 133,152 / 666,904 / 1,675,934 /
    640,870 / 4,430 for N = 0..6, so the thinnest fiber is ~1 in 2,100 slots —
    the fldist table now builds lazily for One-look too, not just Full solve);
    reveal lists every optimal FL line (≤128; a hit cap renders "+N+ more" —
    the deepest states top out at ~88 lines) with its landing face. **My
    solution** — the user enters a fixed layer solution (parsed in the active
    WCA/NS notation, stored verbatim `{raw, nota}` so later toggle flips can't
    reinterpret the letters); scrambles are exact preimages: A = the sequence's
    effect-state from solved, β = a randomized-optimal native descent of A (the
    engine-safe inverse — `invertAlg` text inversion is NOT valid across
    applyParsed evaluations for B/rotation algs), X = β(Y) for a uniform Y among
    the 540 D-layer-solved states, and by simple transitivity running the
    sequence from X lands EXACTLY on Y (test-asserted incl. B/rotation/NS
    sequences); reveal shows Y's diagram + a best-effort case name via a lazy
    stateKey index over every sheet case's 4 presentation states ("not in your
    sheets" on a miss — grading stays the user's). Same-day follow-up (USER
    request): the reveal diagram renders with the solved layer visually on the
    bottom — `netSVG` gained `opts.pinned` (raw `toFacelets`, a whole-cube
    rotation of the same physical picture; the default WCA-hold re-anchor
    moved the layer off D in exactly the 360/540 Y states with a twisted UFL —
    machine-checked; the tradeoff is the fixed corner may read twisted). New core exports
    `randomAtFLDist` / `randomDLayerState` / `preimageOfLayer`; substrate tests
    29 → 33; storage blob gains `onelookView`/`onelookLen`/`onelookSol`/
    `onelookStats` (mode whitelist + hydration + reset extended).
  - **2026-07-06 follow-up (USER request): layer-down diagrams everywhere +
    view feature removed.** ALL trainer case diagrams (drill stage, recognition
    full view + center quiz + stats thumbnails, one-look reveal) now render
    `pinned` so the solved layer always reads on the bottom; only the
    scramble-state diagrams (full solve, one-look stage) keep the WCA-hold
    default. The quiz masks are therefore raw sticker indices — core
    `displayPosMap`/`_rot240` (the re-anchor compensation) DELETED with their
    test (substrate tests 33 → 32). The drill's per-subset Front/Right/Back/
    Left view toggles are REMOVED (user: "the view is not important"): the
    pool is cases at the authored presentation only, known-marks and stats key
    at direction 0 (old `uid␟0` data stays valid; stray non-zero rows still
    display with a direction suffix), `dirSel` dropped from the storage blob.
    Recognition keeps its y² coin-flip (canon-equivalent angle variety; the
    "Back view" tag shows only on flips), and the core's 4-presentation
    keying machinery (`casePres`/`stateForDir`/`prependAUF`) stays — it backs
    recognition, alg y-chips, and the one-look reverse lookup.
- [x] **M7 — Solver** (2026-07-07). **Movecount-only scope per USER decision**
  ("simple movecount metrics; fingertrick metrics later once I speak with top
  solvers; solutions go through the layer — or applicable first step — then an
  algorithm; rotations allowed mid-solve; organize by movecount"), superseding
  the old fl/flm1/psfl proposal. `js/solver-core.js` rewritten:
  `METHOD_DEFS = fl / tcll / eg2` — the first steps of the ACTUAL imported
  sheets, machine-probed from `data/skewb_algs.json`: NS cases are D-layer
  states (fl = a layer on any face; 540/face, 3,110 distinct, max dist 6),
  TCLL cases are layer-with-exactly-ONE-free-corner-twisted (2,160/face,
  11,964, max 6), EG2 cases are layer-with-the-free-pairs-swapped (540/face,
  3,204, max 7); membership verified for 134/135 + 1,076/1,080 + 136/136
  cases (5 known sheet outliers). Caps default 7/6/7. The two-phase DFS search
  ports from upstream, but **buildRotations is DELETED** — searching the 12
  rotation framings adds no physical solutions on a Skewb (A4 conjugation
  permutes the native moves and the any-face targets bijectively), so the
  search runs once in the identity frame; `ergoScore` is DELETED (score =
  executed movecount; buckets sort by shortest first step). New `methodView`
  builds the staged reconstruction "first step | rotation bringing the layer
  to the bottom | algorithm" via a generalized WCA emitter that mirrors
  applyParsed exactly (incl. the odd tetrad-swapping frames a mid-solve x/z
  quarter creates) + an init-derived `ROT_TO_D` table; case names come from a
  lazy canon index over BOTH y-quarter canons of every compiled-sheet case
  (`CNAME` alone covers only authored canons — 1,333/1,351 cases partial);
  naming coverage 535/540 fl, 2,160/2,160 tcll, 539/540 eg2, and 100 % of
  finishes named in a 200-scramble scan. The core re-verifies every emitted
  line and drops (+counts) any failure. solver.js deltas: sliders/weights/
  offsets/`migrateWeights` deleted; prefs = methods/caps/slack/maxCancel
  (shape-validated; saved via OOAccount); WCA/NS toolbar switch (shared
  `skewbiks-notation`; scramble parsed in the active notation); opening
  search window dopt..dopt+3 (method solutions cluster above the optimum);
  movecount chips dopt..12, ungated (worst observed search 169 ms). Engine:
  `composeSym` un-exported (`faceCompose`/`FACE_ID` are now used by the new
  core; `optimalSolution`/`symFromFacePerm` stay for tests). Gates: NEW
  `npm run test:solver` (14 tests — pinned target counts, sheet-case
  membership, reduction/emitter equivalence, naming coverage, fixture
  soundness with every solution AND method view machine-verified, plus 50
  constructed P·A decompositions found = completeness spot-check);
  `tools/solver-lab.mjs` re-fixtured (`--scan 200`: 0 verify failures, 0
  truncations, best solution at optimal for 175/200); engine 48/48, trainer
  32/32, build + `check:fresh` green; headless-Edge E2E 10/10 incl. an
  in-browser proof that every displayed final solution solves the typed
  scramble.
  - **Rotation-convention finding (machine-verified 2026-07-07, USER decision
    pending):** the engine's `x/y/z` tokens are each the PHYSICAL INVERSE of
    the WCA/cubing.js rotation of the same name — every prior oracle used
    180° rotations, which are direction-blind. See ground-truth §"Notation
    notes" for the full statement and the cost of flipping it. The solver
    prints engine-convention tokens (they parse + verify site-wide, matching
    the trainer's y-chips); revisit after the convention decision.
  - **2026-07-07 follow-up (USER report: "algorithms executing from the wrong
    angles — they should be done exactly how it is listed on the algorithm
    page"). Finishes are now THE SHEET ALGORITHMS VERBATIM**, superseding the
    machine-optimal finishes (and with them: slack/maxCancel options, junction
    cancellation, the movecount length-chips, the canon-name index, and the
    compiled-sheet dependency — solver.html no longer loads js/sheet.js;
    like algs.html and the trainer it fetches `data/skewb_algs.json` at boot,
    leaving js/sheet.js + classmap.json as build-gate artifacts with no page
    consumer). Core rework: every alg's authored `ns` text is indexed by the
    exact states it solves from each of the 24 whole-cube holds (fast
    frame-table evaluator over the 24-orientation group — 233 ms vs 11.8 s
    through applyParsed; equivalence covered by the per-item verification);
    a junction then matches by plain stateKey lookup, and the display
    rotation = the matched hold right-divided by the first step's end frame
    — EXACT, not guessed, because WHICH hold executes a text is a property
    of the text (959 algs embed their own setup rotations) and the frame
    machinery is deliberately not conjugation-equivariant for free-corner
    letters. Movecount = first step + the verbatim text's own move tokens
    (the sheets sometimes write R R where the conversion says R2); 34
    slash-alternate texts don't parse and are skipped (their cases carry
    other algs). UI: one search per Solve (no length chips; buckets ascend,
    3 shown + expander), verbatim alg line with case name + rating, full
    solution line in NS. Verbatim-finish coverage over the method spaces:
    2,733/3,110 fl, 10,392/11,964 tcll, 3,180/3,204 eg2 (the gaps trace to
    the same rotation-semantics question as the x/y/z inversion — states
    view-equivalent physically but not reachable by any "rotation + text"
    under the engine's reading; every DISPLAYED line still machine-verifies,
    and in a 200-scramble scan every scramble had solutions — best within
    optimal+2 for 99 %, 595,554 solutions verified, 0 failures, worst search
    176 ms). test:solver reworked to 13 tests (index re-verification through
    the real applyParsed, pinned coverage, verbatim-text membership,
    constructed-decomposition completeness); lab reworked accordingly.
    Engine follow-up queued: physically validate the rotation-token
    composition rules (walk left-compose vs token right-compose) together
    with the x/y/z direction decision.
  - **2026-07-07 revision (USER: the alg's leading rotations "should not be
    listed — it should be the rotations needed to get to the position the
    first move starts at"): leading rotation tokens are folded out of the
    indexed/displayed text** (`foldLeadRots` in solver-core `algIndex`), so
    the one printed setup rotation now lands directly on the alg's first
    turn; mid-alg rotations stay verbatim, and from the first turn on the
    text is still exactly the Algorithms page's. The fold is exact — a
    leading rotation only shifts WHICH of the 24 holds matches, and all 24
    are swept — so the index (45,057 states) and the coverage numbers above
    are bit-identical; probe: 3,074 of 3,082 parseable texts folded, 8 had
    no leading rotations, 0 fell back (the raw-text cut is only taken when
    the remainder re-parses to exactly the un-cut token tail). test:solver
    oracles updated: displayed text must lead with a turn and token-match a
    sheet body after its leading rotations.
  - **Same-day rework (USER reports: printed setup rotations physically
    wrong — "y x" should be "y' z"; then, after a per-token respelling fix,
    two more junctions showed "y x'" and "y2 z" where the derivation gave
    different orientations): the solver's hold/rotation logic now runs in a
    PHYSICAL facelet model** (js/solver-core.js), because the engine's
    frame-walk reading of texts is physically faithful only from IDENTITY
    starts — machine-discriminated 2026-07-07: fixed-hand-positions +
    fixed-axis rotations solves 3,082/3,082 imported texts from their
    identity pre-states (grip-relative reading: 641), while behind a
    rotation prefix the engine's hold claims are physically false (the
    USER's junctions are the counterexamples). Design: per folded body Φ the
    index stores Φ⁻¹ of the 24 solved orientations (leading-rotation fold =
    exactly a SOLVED24 permutation — still free); a junction matches iff
    some rotation R of the junction the HUMAN holds hits the set (the human
    junction is W(J): the displayed first step substitutes WCA B / NS b for
    native-UFL moves, leaving the cube walk-rotated — a second bug the
    engine junction masked); the printed rotation is the nicest matching R
    spelled in SHEET letters (sheet x/y/z = physical z/y/x′); every
    displayed line carries a facelet proof (methodView ok). All perms are
    anchored to the TNoodle-validated engine facelet moves (construction
    self-checks throw). Index: 65,640 pre-states / 73,968 entries, ~200 ms
    build (the old hold-evaluator is deleted); coverage counts unchanged
    (2,733/10,392/3,180 — the match relation agreed with the old index; the
    rotations did not); search ~207 ms on the KPW fixture, all solutions
    physically verified. Post-review hardening from the fold's multi-agent
    review (4 confirmed minor): grouping-character texts never fold
    (paren-mangling class killed; zero shipped texts affected), CLAUDE.md
    data-flow "verbatim" sentence reconciled. test:solver reworked to 19
    tests: physical corpus anchor (all 3,082), emitPhysPerm ≡ displayed-text
    execution + walk factorization, index/coverage pins, and the three
    USER-executed junction rotations pinned end-to-end through search().
    Ground truth §Notation notes rewritten accordingly (engine hold reading
    physically falsified; the ~12 % coverage gap is a property of the
    sheets, not an artifact).
  - **Same-day post-review fixes (multi-agent review, 14 confirmed findings,
    1 refuted):** solver-core — `canonIndex` seeds ALL authored canons from
    `CNAME` before indexing y-quarter neighbours (3 cases previously displayed
    a foreign case's name; new test pins `canonIndex == CNAME` over all 1,402
    authored canons), `methodView` no longer prints a "bring the layer to the
    bottom" rotation when the first step already solved the cube, and
    `search()` sanitizes non-finite slack/maxCancel/caps (NaN silently
    disabled every pruning comparison — a trailing `--cancel` flag stack-
    overflowed the lab); solver.js — the notation toggle CONVERTS the
    scramble text (the token sets overlap across WCA/NS with different
    corners, so a re-Solve after toggling silently solved a different
    scramble), truncation is tracked per length (chips read "≥N found",
    cards "(incomplete)"), and renders no longer wipe an in-progress scramble
    draft (async loadPrefs could land mid-typing); solver-lab — numeric flag
    validation, `Math.imul` LCG (the float product collapsed the seed space
    to 16k values), correct `optimal+k` bucket tags, and `--scan` now exits
    non-zero on truncation/no-solution at default tuning, not just verify
    failures. test:solver 14 → 15 tests (pinned ROT_TO_D + frame identity,
    canonIndex/CNAME regression, fin=0 rotation guard). Re-verified end to
    end: all runners green, `--scan 200` (147/147 finishes named, 0
    failures, worst 160 ms), build + `check:fresh` green, E2E 10/10.

  (headless-Edge render recipe), robots/sitemap already point at skewbiks.com, SETUP/README
  final, pre-announce checklist (deployed-rules diff, Firebase authorized domains incl.

## Remaining plan + review carry-items (2026-07-03 — read before starting M5)

Standing goals for the rest of the port: (1) main is always committed and green at
its own milestone's bar; (2) each milestone deletes its own Pyraminx leftovers
rather than deferring to a big-bang cleanup; (3) data formats that hold live user
data (done-bitmap, solution docs) are frozen and documented before M4 goes live;
(4) first boot stays fast enough to not need an apology in the boot hint.

Items the 2026-07-03 OO code review adds to the milestones above:

- **M4:** DONE — carry-items (a)/(b)/(c) landed, and the USER console steps +
  live round-trip completed (verified via Firebase MCP 2026-07-06; see the M4
  status entry).
- **M5:** LANDED (see the status entry) — the dead algs.js destructuring of dropped
  contract members (`applyMoveK`/`openOfEkey`/`barOfEkey`) is gone and
  `npm run build`/`check:fresh` are green. Standing rule now in effect: run
  `check:fresh` before every commit.
- **M6:** LANDED — `R.COLORS` un-exported (nothing imports it; the trainer's
  subset chips use their own hex palette, not the face colors).
- **M7:** LANDED (see the status entry) — `composeSym` un-exported; `FACE_ID`/
  `faceCompose` are used by the new solver-core, `optimalSolution`/
  `symFromFacePerm` by the test runners, so they stay.
- **M8:** as specced.

Known-acceptable, deliberately NOT fixed (don't re-litigate without new evidence):
the BFS builder exists twice on purpose (js/tables.js browser + tools/lib/
bfs-dist.mjs Node — documented in the latter's header; if you optimize one, do
both); the BFS allocates a fresh state per move probe (~25M short-lived objects on
first boot — a scratch-state `applyMoveIdx` variant is the fix if boot time ever
matters again); `enumFreeSlots` recomputes `twistDigits` in its inner loops
(trivial cost); pageBrowse re-fetches doneMap per navigation (candidate for a
session cache); render.js re-declares FACES/FIDX/FNORM locally; the moderator
approval cap check is best-effort/racy by design (documented at the call site).

## Recorded numbers (from M1 verification — use these, don't recompute by hand)

3,149,280 reachable states; depth histogram = OEIS A079745 (max 11, 90 antipodes);
262,674 rotation classes; **131,391 census positions (24-sym fold — what oo.html counts)**,
of which 108 are self-mirror; NSLOTS/rules bound 9,447,840;
per-depth ROTATION-class counts 1/2/4/24/144/854/4,943/26,272/102,155/121,404/6,852/19
(the census's per-depth counts are the 24-fold ones shown on the Browse tab).
